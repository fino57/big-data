"A whole slide image of clear-cell ovarian carcinoma at low resolution shows a solid tumor mass with a mix of cystic and solid areas. Tumor appears heterogeneous with light and dark regions. Sharp demarcation from adjacent normal tissue."
"A whole slide image of high-grade serous carcinoma at low resolution displays a complex, papillary architecture with solid areas. Tumor shows irregular borders and infiltrative growth pattern."
"A whole slide image of low-grade serous carcinoma at low resolution exhibits a more orderly papillary architecture compared to HGSC. Tumor appears less infiltrative with smoother borders."
"A whole slide image of endometrioid carcinoma at low resolution shows a glandular architecture resembling endometrial tissue. Tumor may have a more solid appearance in poorly differentiated areas."
"A whole slide image of mucinous carcinoma at low resolution exhibits a multilocular cystic appearance with variable-sized cysts. Some areas may show more solid growth."
"A whole slide image of clear-cell ovarian carcinoma at high resolution reveals large polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm and distinct cell boundaries. Nuclei are hyperchromatic and pleomorphic. Characteristic "hobnail" cells with nuclei bulging into cystic spaces are visible."
"A whole slide image of high-grade serous carcinoma at high resolution displays marked nuclear atypia with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Nuclei are highly pleomorphic with prominent nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures and areas of necrosis are present."
"A whole slide image of low-grade serous carcinoma at high resolution exhibits uniform population of cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia. Psammoma bodies (calcified concretions) are often visible."
"A whole slide image of endometrioid carcinoma at high resolution shows back-to-back glands lined by columnar cells with stratified nuclei. Squamous differentiation may be present. Nuclear atypia varies with tumor grade."
"A whole slide image of mucinous carcinoma at high resolution exhibits tall columnar cells with abundant intracellular mucin, often with goblet cell features. Nuclei are usually basally located. Degree of nuclear atypia varies with tumor grade."
