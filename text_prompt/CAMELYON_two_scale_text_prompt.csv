"Normal lymph node, low resolution: Oval structure with smooth border. Preserved architecture shows lighter cortex peripherally, darker medulla centrally. Evenly distributed follicles in cortex. No irregular masses or distortions visible."
"Metastatic lymph node, low resolution: Enlarged, irregularly shaped with distorted architecture. Effaced cortex-medulla distinction. Irregular metastatic deposits visible. Thickened/breached capsule. Abnormal blood vessel distribution."
"Normal lymph node, high resolution: Uniform small lymphocytes densely packed. Well-formed follicles in cortex, lymphocyte cords in medulla. Thin-walled blood vessels throughout. No atypical cells or architectural distortions."
"Metastatic lymph node, high resolution: Large, pleomorphic cancer cells interspersed in lymphoid tissue. Cells show irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, abundant cytoplasm. Atypical cell arrangements. Desmoplasia, increased mitoses, potential necrosis. Abnormal blood vessels present."
